# CS141 Intermediate Data Structures & Algorithms

---------
Description
---------

Explores basic algorithm analysis using asymptotic notations, summation and recurrence relations, and algorithms and data structures for discrete structures including trees, strings, and graphs. Also covers general algorithm design techniques including "divide-and-conquer," the greedy method, and dynamic programming. Integrates knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and programming.
