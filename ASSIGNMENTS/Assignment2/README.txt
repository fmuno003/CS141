### Seam Carving

The input is taken from a file that is inputted on the command line. These values are comma separated values and the purpose is to find the minimum cost seam in the input file. The algorithm will check for the lowest minimum seam and store it on the last row of values since the values are stored into a point class with an x and y value. The x value is the cost of each seam and the y value is the minimum seam up to that point in the array. In the end once the minimum seam is calculated, the trace back begins and is printed into another file with the cintent being the row, column, and the cost at that point.
